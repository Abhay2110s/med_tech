⚕️ MedTech : Comprehensive Health & Emergency Assistant

!

🌟 Project Overview

The MedTech Repository is a suite of integrated applications and services designed to bring personal health monitoring and emergency response capabilities right to the user's fingertips. Our goal is to leverage technology to enhance proactive health management, provide immediate assistance during medical crises, and offer reliable, intelligent first-aid guidance.

This repository contains the core logic, APIs, and front-end components for all MedTech services.

✨ Core Features

Our platform is built around several critical features focused on user safety and health awareness:

1. 🩸 Blood Pressure (BP) Monitoring

Real-time Data Sync: Connects with compatible external devices (e.g., smart cuffs) to automatically log and sync blood pressure readings.

Trend Analysis: Visualizes historical BP data, identifying trends, averages, and time-of-day variations.

Alert System: Provides proactive notifications if readings fall outside pre-set healthy ranges.

2. 🆘 Emergency SOS

One-Tap Activation: A quick, prominent interface button to immediately trigger an emergency sequence.

Geo-Location Sharing: Automatically shares the user's precise location (latitude and longitude) with pre-selected emergency contacts and/or professional services.

Customizable Messages: Sends a template message to contacts with the location link and a status update (e.g., "I need urgent help, I am at [link]").

3. 🩹 First Aid Assistant (AI-Powered)

Symptom-Based Guidance: Users can input symptoms (e.g., "Burn injury," "Choking," "Severe cut") and receive step-by-step, simplified first-aid instructions.

Visual and Text Guides: Instructions are presented clearly using accessible language, supported by illustrative text.

Offline Capability: Core first-aid protocols are available even without an active internet connection, ensuring reliability in remote situations.

4. 📈 Holistic Health Metrics & Tracking

Vitals Dashboard: Tracks and displays other essential vitals, such as Heart Rate (HR), Oxygen Saturation (SpO2), and step count (integration dependent).

Medication Reminders: Users can schedule and manage daily medication intake, receiving timely alerts.

Health Journal: A secure logging feature for users to record symptoms, mood, diet, and notes for later review with a medical professional.
